Every year, Kaggle conducts an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. Using their survey or data, I have done an EDA with an intention of understanding the status of data science and machine learning in Africa. 
This EDA will leave you with a clear picture of the development and the current status qou of our beloved data science field in Africa.
